# breedHS code instances

Use these instances as templates for running breedHS. They are organized by institution and pairing protocol:
- `hsw`: Use this code for in-house pairing at HS West (using only rats produced at HSW)
- `wfu`: Use this code for in-house pairing at Wake Forest (using only rats produced at WFU)
- `hsw_exchange`: Use this code for pairing exchange generations at HS West (when HSW receives breeders from WFU)
- `wfu_exchange`: Use this code for pairing exchange generations at Wake Forest (when WFU eceives breeders from HSW)

### Code status
Last updated 2 May 2025 by Ben Johnson

- Code in `hsw` is stable and should be usable as-is after filling out the arguments file.
- No code present in `wfu` yet. Some functions have been written and I began testing hypothetical WFU pairings during HSW gen104, but status is incomplete. This code base should be finished ASAP
- No code present in `hsw_exchange` yet. HSW last received from WFU in gen101. Adapt from that generation's code to set this instance.
- No code present in `wfu_exchange` yet. Some functions have been written and I began testing hypothetical WFU pairings during HSW gen104, but status is incomplete. This code base should be finished ASAP
